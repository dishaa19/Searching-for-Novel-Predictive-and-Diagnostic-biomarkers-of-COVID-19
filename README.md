# Searching-for-Novel-Predictive-and-Diagnostic-biomarkers-of-COVID-19

The main aim is to generate predictive models to classify patients with Covid-19. 
Discovering rapid and accurate diagnostic biomarkers of COVID-19. 
Also Identifying predictive biomarkers of disease severity. This shows my keen interest in the field of Machine Learning 
and Deep learning

Using different machine learning approaches in Python and R.
